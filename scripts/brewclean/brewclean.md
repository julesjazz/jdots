## Brew Cleanup Script

Here's a comprehensive `brewclean` script to clean up your Homebrew installation:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Brew Cleanup Script
# This script performs a comprehensive cleanup of Homebrew

echo "🧹 Starting Homebrew cleanup..."

# Update Homebrew
echo "📦 Updating Homebrew..."
brew update

# Upgrade all packages
echo "⬆️  Upgrading all packages..."
brew upgrade

# Clean up old versions
echo "🗑️  Cleaning up old versions..."
brew cleanup

# Remove orphaned dependencies
echo "🔍 Removing orphaned dependencies..."
brew autoremove

# Clean up cache
echo "💾 Cleaning cache..."
brew cleanup --prune=all

# Check for issues
echo "🔧 Checking for issues..."
brew doctor

# Show disk usage
echo "💿 Disk usage after cleanup:"
brew cleanup --dry-run

echo "✅ Homebrew cleanup complete!"
```

To use this script:
1. Save it as `brewclean.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x brewclean.sh`
