# this was created in an attempt to get stow/rsync to exclude desired directory files correctly, it may not be working but keeping as a reference, it may be best to add exclusions to .gitignore on until a better stow/rsync filter can be devised

# eg: rsync -a --delete --exclude-from=.rsyncignore ~/.config/logs/ stowfiles/config/logs/
