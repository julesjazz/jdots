# Goal:
1. set up neovim to be a fully featured IDE
2. panes should include: project directory list, current file editing window, a terminal section that I can toggle, a section to the right for cli LLM reference or other terminal commands
3. plugins to support my workflow
4. neovim configs and plugins should reside in ~/.config/nvim, if a config file needs to exist in ~ add it with a pointer to ~/.config/nvim instead of using a symlink

# My workflow
Role: Site Reliability Engineer
Tools:
- zsh, bash, powershell, nushell
- docker and kubernetes containers
- editors: neovim, vscode, cursor
