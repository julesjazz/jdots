# Prfoles
Use profiles to define different environments.
- goal: when setting up new, define environments in a list like `dev, game, etc`
- goal: make this aware of gui environments and work across MacOS, major Linux distros, and WSL
- `_common` will be installed on all computers

## Initial common profile example
```yml
profile: _common
description: "Base configuration shared across all systems and profiles"
notes:
  - "defines the base configuration shared across all systems and profiles"
  - "asdf-resolved is auto-generated by the Makefile resolve-asdf-versions.sh script"
  - "packages section is for terminal or gui environments"
  - "overlays section is only for gui applications"
asdf:
  - nodejs@lts
# etc...
packages:
  brew:
    common:
      - git
      - stow
      - make
    # etc...
